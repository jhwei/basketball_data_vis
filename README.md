# Basketball Shooting Visualization

This is a course project for CMPS263 of 2017 Winter

The repository contains code for data wrangling and visualization.

## Visualization Link

The online visualization is [here](http://jhwei.github.io/basketball_data_vis/vis_d3/)

## Software

Python is used for data wrangling. Jupyter is used for writing Python scripts.

Bokeh and matplotlib is used for start stage visualization.

D3 and Javascript is used for final visualization.

## Open Source Package for Final Visualization

[D3 (V3)](http://github.com/d3/d3) and [D3-hexbin](http://github.com/d3/d3-hexbin) from [d3js.org](http://d3js.org/).

[D3-slider](http://github.com/MasterMaps/d3-slider) from [MasterMaps](http://mastermaps.com/).

[D3-tip](http://labratrevenge.com/d3-tip/) from [Caged](http://github.com/Caged).

[D3-shotchart](http://github.com/mamcmanus/d3-shotchart) from [Matt McManus](http://mamcmanus.com/) (There is some problem with the original code, so I edit some functions and add some other functions I need).

## Inspiration Source

I get inspiration from:
* [Every shot Kobe Bryant ever took](http://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/)
* [The Evolution of King James](http://grantland.com/features/how-lebron-james-transformed-game-become-highly-efficient-scoring-machine/)
* [Where the Heat and the Thunder Hit Their Shots](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html?_r=2&)
* [Buckets: NBA Shot Visualization](http://buckets.peterbeshai.com/app)  (Some of the visualization ideas come from this visualization)

## Folder Explaination

The folder *vis_d3* contains the final visualization code. The folder *data_wrangling* contains the code for data wrangling. The folder *vis_bokeh* contains the code for visualization by bokeh which I used in early stage for visualization.
